# Watch Face Maker

Very, very early stage in browser editor for watchmaker watch faces. 

## Demo

http://ne70.com/

## Working
* Basic import of watchmaker face (unziping of archive parsing of watch layers into json schema for editing)
* Display of watchmaker faces image layers

## TODO
* Figure out correct dimensions for watches and faces layers
* Complete JSON schemas for watchmaker and facer
* Draw text layers, load fonts.
* Draw shape layers.
* Add switch for always on mode.
* Image/Font upload into browser memory
* Correct packaging of files for download, create dirs and add images
* Function interp. for hands etc. (display current time on face and show animations)
* Simulate data (weather, heart rate, etc.)
* Deal with facer's multiple JSON files

## Possible future features
* Drag and drop (interact.js?)
* Convert between facer and watchmaker
* Direct upload to facerepo
* Save changes (browser cache or server?)
* Undo option
* Chrome App
